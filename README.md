# AoC2021
Advent of code 2021 challenges done in c#. First time I did something of this kind.
Did not compete for speed. Did not use internet during any of the challenges for anything.
In my experience the challenges themself do not give you much if you already have some mileage.
Comparing the eventual program to other contenders, did give me something however.
Especially comparison with people who used the same programming language was sometimes fruitfull.
